# BURGER APPLICATION
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page. Each burger displayed in this area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page and be marked as "Devoured". Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
